In this article, I discuss the antecedents, definitions, processes, and purposes of action research in the field of English language teaching. Action research is also considered in relation to more established notions of basic and applied research. The current scope and nature of action research studies found in the literature are then analysed. The article concludes with a consideration of some of the challenges to the status of action research as a research methodology and the issues that will need to be addressed if action research by language teachers is to be sustainable.},

"Updated with a majority of new readings, the Third Edition of Readings in Urban Theory expands its focus to present the most recent developments in urban and regional theories and policies in a globalized world. Around 75\% of the readings included are new for the fourth edition Unifies readings by an orientation toward political economy and normative themes of social justice Expands the focus on international planning, including globalization and theories of development Addresses the full range of core urban theory so as to remain the primary text in courses"--Provided by publisher. "Over the last two decades great strides have been made in urban theory. Drawing on works in geography, planning, design, history, sociology, political science, and cultural studies, the new Third Edition of Readings in Urban Theory presents the most recent developments in the field while also reflecting its highly interdisciplinary nature. These carefully selected readings -- approximately three quarters new for this edition -- address issues that represent the fundamental underpinnings of urban theory. These include the changing urban and regional system, the social impacts of these policies, the effects of publicly sponsored redevelopment programs, cultural meanings of spatial relations, and many others. In addition, this new edition expands its focus of urban planning issues beyond the U.S. and U.K. to reflect a more globalized world. Collectively, these readings from leading scholars offer both a realistic depiction of the new urban and regional environment and innovative approaches to explaining its underlying causes, meanings, and consequences. By presenting an incisive overview and analysis of the most current theories behind urban and regional development, the Third Edition of Readings in Urban Theory goes a long way in helping us make sense of today's world"--Provided by publisher. 1 Introduction: Theories of Urban Development and Their Implications for Policy and Planning (Susan S.

	title = {The {State} of {World} {Fisheries} and {Aquaculture} 2012},
	isbn = {978-92-5-107225-7},
	abstract = {A milestone may be near. After growing steadily, particularly in the last four decades, aquaculture is for the first time set to contribute half of the fish consumed by the human population worldwide. This reflects not only the vitality of the aquaculture sector but also global economic growth and continuing developments in fish processing and trade. Until a year or so ago, the production trends in aquaculture and capture fisheries were continuing without any drastic modification to those already in place at the start of this decade. The capture fisheries sector was regularly producing between 90 and 95 million tonnes per year, and aquaculture production was growing rapidly, albeit at a gradually declining rate. However, the substantial increases in energy and food prices, which started in 2007 and have continued into 2008, as well as the threat of climate change, mean that the conditions for capture fisheries and aquaculture are changing. That said, the combined effects of rising prices and climate change are complex, and they affect a very large number of fisheries and aquaculture operations in a mosaic of natural, social and economic contexts. Hence, it is too early to have a clear understanding of the cumulative impact worldwide on fisheries and aquaculture. Nonetheless, it is clear that there will be both winners and losers among fishers, aquaculturists and those employed in ancillary industries. On the one hand, rising prices for staple foods will also cause an increase in the price of many fish and fish products, and this will stimulate all in the sector to produce more. However, those who capture or culture fish, or other aquatic animals, using energy-intensive forms of production may find recent cost increases prohibitive. They may well face difficulties in continuing in their occupation, at least in the immediate future. On the other hand, low-intensity aquaculture and most small-scale and artisanal fisheries will attempt to expand production. This will increase the importance of improved governance in both aquaculture and low-energy-consuming fisheries (some near-shore fisheries, passive fishing gear, etc.). This issue of The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture features some of the aspects of fisheries and aquaculture that may receive increasing attention. Among these aspects are climate change, the use of marine genetic resources in areas beyond national jurisdiction, and the proliferation of private standards and certification schemes in the international fish trade. This issue also highlights a few of FAOs special studies. These include the use of wild-fishery resources as seed and feed in aquaculture, and reviews of the worlds shrimp fisheries and of the management of marine capture fisheries in the Pacific Ocean. The format of The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture remains unchanged. As with previous editions, this issue contains a CDROM with the World Fisheries and Aquaculture Atlas.},

	abstract = {Hospitals are convenient settings for the deployment of context-aware applications. The information needs of hospital workers are highly dependent on contextual variables, such as location, role and activity. While some of these parameters can be easily determined, others, such as activity are much more complex to estimate. This paper describes an approach to estimate the activity being performed by hospital workers. The approach is based on information gathered from a workplace study conducted in a hospital, in which 196 h of detailed observation of hospital workers was recorded. Contextual information, such as the location of hospital workers, artifacts being used, the people with whom they collaborate and the time of the day, is used to train a back propagation neural network to estimate hospital workers activities. The activities estimated include clinical case assessment, patient care, preparation, information management, coordination and classes and certification. The results indicate that the user activity can be correctly estimated 75\% of the time (on average) which is good enough for several applications. We discuss how these results can be used in the design of activity-aware applications, arguing that recent advances in pervasive and networking technologies hold great promises for the deployment of such applications. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Remote clients, called EvoWorkers, connect to EvoSpace and periodically take a subset of individuals from the global population, perform evolutionary operations on them, and return a set of new individuals. Several EvoWorkers carry out the evolutionary search in parallel and asynchronously, interacting with each other through the central repository. EvoSpace is designed to be domain independent and flexible, in the sense that in can be used with different types of evolutionary algorithms and applications. In this paper, a genetic algorithm is tested on the EvoSpace platform using a well-known benchmark problem, achieving promising results compared to a standard evolutionary system.},

Second, we compute representative Eigenfeatures for feature extraction. Third, facial expression classification is made with a Support Vector Machine Committiee.
